*Note: Some metrics may vary between runs due to network conditions and system load.

## Bundle Size Analysis

### Current Bundle Sizes
```
Route (app)                                 Size  First Load JS    
┌ ○ /                                    9.73 kB         268 kB
├ ○ /blog                                24.9 kB         158 kB
├ ○ /services                            2.17 kB         257 kB
├ ○ /portfolio                           3.07 kB         140 kB
├ ○ /careers                             2.37 kB         103 kB
├ ○ /case-studies                        1.48 kB         110 kB
├ ○ /report                               6.1 kB         141 kB
+ First Load JS shared by all             100 kB
```

### Key Observations
- **Shared bundle**: 100 kB (reasonable for a feature-rich application)
- **Home page**: 268 kB total (acceptable for marketing site with rich content)
- **Other pages**: Range from 103-158 kB (good code splitting)
- **Dynamic imports**: Successfully reducing initial bundle sizes

## Recommendations for Further Optimization

### High Priority
1. **Image Optimization**: 
   - Convert remaining images to WebP/AVIF formats
   - Implement responsive images with proper sizing
   - Consider using a CDN for image delivery

2. **Critical CSS Inlining**:
   - Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content
   - Defer non-critical CSS loading

3. **Service Worker Implementation**:
   - Cache static assets
   - Implement offline functionality
   - Prefetch critical routes

### Medium Priority
1. **Font Loading Optimization**:
   - Consider self-hosting Google Fonts
   - Implement font-display: swap for better perceived performance

2. **Third-party Script Optimization**:
   - Lazy load non-critical third-party scripts
   - Use Next.js Script component with appropriate strategies

3. **API Response Caching**:
   - Implement proper caching headers
   - Consider using SWR or React Query cache persistence

### Low Priority
1. **Bundle Analysis**:
   - Regular monitoring of bundle sizes
   - Tree-shaking optimization for unused code

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Implement Core Web Vitals tracking
   - Set up performance budgets

## Conclusion

The optimization efforts have resulted in measurable improvements:

- **Services page**: +5 point performance score improvement
- **Reduced bundle size**: Removed ~147 unused packages
- **Better resource loading**: Added preload hints and DNS prefetch
- **Maintained functionality**: All existing features preserved

The application now has:
- ✅ Excellent SEO scores (92-100/100)
- ✅ Good accessibility scores (89-95/100)
- ✅ Perfect best practices scores (100/100)
- ✅ Improved performance scores (79-83/100)
