# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating a complete React application (ReactApp) built with Vite, React Router, and TypeScript to a Next.js 15 application with App Router. The ReactApp is a marketing agency website with multiple pages, components, services, and complex routing. The migration must preserve all functionality while adapting to Next.js conventions and leveraging Next.js features like server-side rendering, optimized routing, and improved performance.
